LAB 3, Part 2
-------------

**Part 2: (40 pts)**
*Validation of security controls can be a huge overhead to an organization if done manually. Choose two of the controls to check on an hourly basis. One of the controls must check a value in the database (Oracle MySQL 8.0 :: 2.7, 2.9, or 4.2) This automated check should be implemented using Kubernetes Jobs which you can read about  [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). Again, you must document in your report, take screenshots of your output, and commit all files to your repo for grading.**
